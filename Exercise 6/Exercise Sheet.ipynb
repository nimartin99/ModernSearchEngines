    "- Provides a more balanced similarity measurment because it's based on in- and outgoing links\n",
    "- Solves the bias problem that documents with many outgoing links have when we would only use outgoing links\n",
    "- Also measures the context especially how documents are referenced by others\n",

    "Disadvantages:  \n",
    "- More complex to compute\n",
    "- We assume that incoming and outgoing links are of equal importance, which may not always be true (we could adjust the weight with which they influence the similarity score to solve this)\n",
    "- We could misjudge similarity if for example the outgoing links of two documents are the same but the incoming links have no overlap\n"
